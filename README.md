- 👋 Hi, I’m @tmcf22
- 👀 I’m interested in learning molecular dynamic simulations in GROMACS and LAMMPS, and how to use GPUs to speed up calculations.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use Linux and to code in Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on molecular dynamic simulation projects with a future employer. I am an organic and organometallic chemist who had a taste of computational chemistry and I want MORE!!!
